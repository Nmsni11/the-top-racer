# The Top Racer 

**The Top Racer** is an advanced autonomous racing robot designed as a refined evolution of the original Robot Racer. It leverages a 32-bit Arduino Due microcontroller for ultra-fast performance, DRV8835 motor driver for precision control, and multiple sensors for accurate obstacle and lane detection.


###  Components Used:
- Arduino Due
- DRV8835 Dual Motor Driver
- Planetary DC Motors (x2)
- HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor
- IR Line-Following Sensors (x2)
- LiPo Battery 7.4V with BMS
- Mini Breadboard
- ABS 3D Printed Chassis
- Traction Rubber Wheels
- USB Cable + Charger + Connectors + Power safety components

###  How It Works:
- The robot uses IR sensors to detect and follow lines.
- Ultrasonic sensor continuously measures distance to avoid obstacles.
- The Arduino Due processes inputs at high speed and adjusts motor speeds accordingly using the DRV8835.

###  Power & Safety:
- Powered by a 7.4V 2000mAh LiPo Battery with BMS.
- A power switch and fuse holder are added for circuit safety.
